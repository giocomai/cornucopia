# cornucopia

The goal of `cornucopia` is to facilitate reporting on sponsored and
organic activities across various platforms, including Facebook,
Instagram, and (to a lesser extent, due to lack of usable API) LinkedIn.
Other networks may be added in the future.

## Why call it `cornucopia`?

For you all marketing folks, a cornucopia is like a funnel that keeps on
giving. Also known as the “[horn of
plenty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornucopia)”, it’s basically
really your wildest dream: a funnel that endlessly overflows with
abundance.

Hence, the marketing slogan of `cornucopia` is:

***turn your every funnel into a cornucopia!***

The premise of `cornucopia` is that there’s plenty of small and big
platforms that can be used to interact with the API (or to connect them
to other data visualisation or data processing platforms) of big “social
networks”/advertising platforms, but there’s really just a few open
source packages in the `r` ecosystem openly available in this space.
Some of these packages are of excellent quality, but overall there’s a
steep learning curve when joining this space, and few tools enabling the
beginner-intermediate users to look at these interrelated processes in
an orderly fashion, or to facilitate some routine work for more advanced
users.

Long term, this is the purpose of `cornucopia`, which is currently at an
early stage of development.

As these so called “social networks” are all, at their core, marketing
tools, throughout the package documentation I will use the language
found on each platform’s website and use marketing terms by default.
Needless to say, this can be used for reporting of non-profit websites,
or for optimising conversions that are not purchases, etc.

Please enjoy `cornucopia` responsibly.

## Experimental package warning

Again, keep in mind that this is an incomplete and not fully tested
package. It currently uses only API calls that *read* data, so it should
be safe to use. But:

- it tries to cache data for efficency and speed, but the caching
  mechanisms may not always work, so make sure the extracted data are
  fit for purpose (more testing will be introduced)

Also, the usual disclaimer: this free software comes with absolutely no
warranty.

## Installation

You can install the development version of cornucopia with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("giocomai/cornucopia")
```

## Settings

You can you use
[`cc_set()`](https://giocomai.github.io/cornucopia/reference/cc_set.md)
to set start and end dates to be used by all other functions, as well as
tokens, user identifiers, and caching preferences. You can provide as
many or as few settings as you like. You can also pass the same as
parameters to individual functions, without using
[`cc_set()`](https://giocomai.github.io/cornucopia/reference/cc_set.md)
at all.

``` r
library("cornucopia")
dates_l <- cc_set(
  start_date = "2023-01-01",
  end_date = Sys.Date() - 1,
)

dates_l$start_date
#> [1] "2023-01-01"
```

Here is a full list of parameters that can be set with
[`cc_set()`](https://giocomai.github.io/cornucopia/reference/cc_set.md):

`meta_api_version`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `fb_user_token`,
`fb_page_token`, `fb_page_id`, `fb_business_id`, `fb_ad_account_id`,
`fb_product_catalog_id`, `fb_user_id`, `ig_user_id`, `ga_email`,
`ga_property_id`, `woocommerce_api_version`, `woocommerce_username`,
`woocommerce_password`

## Meta / Facebook / Instagram

In order to get data out of the Meta ecosystem through APIs, you will
need to create an app following the [procedure on their Developer
platform](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/create/).

You can then get your token from your [app
page](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/), after adding the
“Marketing API” (be mindful that if you’re using Facebook “as a page”
rather than as your personal profile, the above link to the app page may
not work… the page doesn’t load without a meaningful error message;
switch back to your main account, and then click again on the link).
When you retrieve your token, you can select permissions: you probably
want to include both “ads_read” and “read_insights”, as they are
read-only and hence safe, while you probably don’t want to tick
“ads_management”, unless you really know what you are doing.

You can also get a token with a different set of options for
customisation, through the [Facebook’s Graph API
explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/). This is
effectively the recommended approach, as you can be more specific about
the permissions granted to your user token. If you don’t get what you
expect, most likely it is a permission problem.

**This is important**: if a function returns an empty result, make sure
that you have the needed permissions… consider adding even temporarily
permissions as you troubleshoot. For examples, you want to see a list of
pages you manage, and you don’t get any result: did you include the
`pages_show_list` permission [when you created your
token](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/)? If pages are
controlled through a business manager, did you include the
`business_management` permission? Etc.

Even so… things, however, are not so easy, as you’ll need to go through
additional steps to get long-lived tokens, Facebook page tokens, etc. -
more details below.

Also, be mindful that the Meta APIs do not always return meaningful
error messages, and the documentation has only few examples… as some
queries work or not depending on the type of ad (its creatives/its
format/etc.) or the type of organic post (is it a video? if so, is it a
reel? etc.), there’s often some trial and error involved.

More broadly, whenever you get an error message that is unclear, think
creatively about what could be wrong: has my token expired? did I exceed
query limit? did I include a field which was not available for this
endpoint? did I use the wrong identifier (e.g. a post id instead of a
video id, or vice versa)?

### Organic - Facebook pages and access tokens

Data about Facebook pages need to be accessed with a Facebook *page*
token, that is separate to the Facebook *user* token.

After retrieving the Facebook user token (as mentioned above, e.g. on
the [Graph API
explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/)), the first
step is then to retrieve one’s own Facebook user id:

``` r
library("cornucopia")
cc_set(fb_user_token = "actual_token_here")

cc_get_fb_user()
```

And then use the Facebook user id to request all pages managed by that
Facebook user (including the relevant Facebook page token if you add
“access_tokens” to the fields):

``` r
cc_set(fb_user_id = "actual_user_id_as_retrieved_with_cc_get_fb_user")

cc_get_fb_managed_pages()
# cc_get_fb_managed_pages(fields = c("id", "name", "access_token"))
```

It is this page token that can then be used to retrieve information
about a given page.

You may hope that things would just work and that you’d see all your
pages when you run
[`cc_get_fb_managed_pages()`](https://giocomai.github.io/cornucopia/reference/cc_get_fb_managed_pages.md).
Things, however, may be not so simple, because of granular permissions.
In other words, you need to explicitly grant permissions to access
pages. As is characteristic of Facebook, they like to move settings
around, but you should be able to add this permission from the [Graph
Api Explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/) (for
context, see also [this answer on
StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/77467164/4124601)).

Select your app from the drop down menu, and then from the “User or
Page” dropdown select: “Get page access token”. You will be asked to
re-authenticate, and then you will be able to choose between:

- “Opt in to all current and future Pages”
- or select from a list of your pages

Then you will see you’ll have more permissions in the list, including

- `pages_show_list`
- `pages_read_engagement`
- `ads_read`
- `read_insights`

You probably want to add also `pages_read_user_content` in order to
retrieve information about your own posts. If you are managing pages
through business manager, this is probably not enough, as you will need
to add also the `business_management` permission. Also consider that if
you want to interact with the Instagram page associated with this page
you will also need:

- `instagram_basic`
- `instagram_manage_insights`

Do remember to re-generate your token after adding permissions to
actually get access.

You can run
[`cc_get_fb_managed_pages()`](https://giocomai.github.io/cornucopia/reference/cc_get_fb_managed_pages.md)
and get the token for all of your pages, or if you know what you’re
looking for, you can get the token for a specific page as follows:

``` r
cc_get_fb_managed_pages()

fb_page_token <- cc_get_fb_page_token(
  fb_user_id = cc_get_fb_user(),
  page_name = "My example page"
)
```

You should be now good to go.

But depending on how you created your token, you may well still be using
a short-lived token. This may be fine, but perhaps you really want to
have a long-lived token, so that you don’t need to constantly retrieve
it again through web interfaces.

In order to get a long-lived user and page token, you need first to get
a short-lived user token with the appropriate authorisations as
described above, and then input your Facebook app id and secret, which
you can retrieve from your [app
page](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/) page.

``` r
cc_get_fb_long_user_token(
  fb_user_token = "your_short_term_token_here",
  fb_app_id = "your_fb_app_id_here",
  fb_app_secret = "your_fb_app_secret_here"
)
```

Then you can use this long-lived user token to get a long-lived Facebook
page access token. With the following function you will get a data frame
with access tokens to all pages to which your short-lived tokens has
access (you can select just a few or include all from the web interface
when you create the short-lived access token).

``` r
cc_get_fb_long_page_token(
  fb_user_id = "your_fb_user_id_here",
  fb_user_token = "your_long_term_token_here"
)
```

#### A word of caution about access tokens

Store these access tokens safely: while long-lived user access token
expire after 60 days, long-lived page access tokens *do not expire*. We
are solidly in password territory here: make sure you do not include
these tokens in scripts you share, as they can be used to retrieve data,
and, especially if you’re not really careful when you create them, do
all sorts of other things, including posting to your page or creating
ads. In theory, these permissions are super-granular, but in practice,
especially for the pages you control through a Business Manager account,
getting the right set of access in place is not straightforward (and
maybe, not even possible). So eventually you may end up with access
tokens with substantial access: treat them as you would treat secret
passwords, and use them with care.

At this stage, all functions in this package use only read API, but the
same access tokens may potentially be used for other APIs. So… take
care.

#### Using the `keyring` package for storing tokens securely

Throughout this readme and the documentation, reference is made to
tokens as if they were directly included in scripts. As mentioned above,
this is less than ideal, as this potentially implies having tokens
stored as plain-text in scripts, as well as in local history files or
server logs.

A convenient and much safer approach relies on the [`keyring`
package](https://keyring.r-lib.org/index.html), which allows to store
tokens using your operating system’s credential store.

Here is how a `keyring` based workflow would work.

First, go the [Graph API
explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/) page and be
ready to retrieve your Facebook user token, then run the following
command to input it interactively and store it in your operating
system’s keyring.

``` r
library("cornucopia")

library("keyring")

keyring::key_set(service = "fb_user_token")
```

Notice that `fb_user_token` here is just the way I decide to name this
in my local keyring: I can give this whatever name I like, or add the
`username` argument if I plan to use more than one account.

Then I would usually need to add my Facebook user id. With the following
command, I can retrieve and store the relevant id without even seeing it
in the console.

``` r
keyring::key_set_with_value(
  service = "fb_user_id",
  password = cc_get_fb_user(
    fb_user_token = keyring::key_get(service = "fb_user_token")
  ) |>
    dplyr::pull(id)
)
```

In order to add safely your Facebook page token, you could then proceed
as follows.

First, get the exact name or id of your Facebook page with:

``` r
cc_get_fb_managed_pages()
```

And store the relevant page id with:

``` r
keyring::key_set(
  service = "fb_page_id",
  username = "My example page"
)
```

Then retrieve and store the Facebook page token in a single command:

``` r
keyring::key_set_with_value(
  service = "fb_page_token",
  username = "My example page", # use your page name, if you manage more than one page
  password = cc_get_fb_page_token(
    fb_user_id = keyring::key_get(service = "fb_user_id"),
    fb_user_token = keyring::key_get(service = "fb_user_token"),
    page_id = keyring::key_get(
      service = "fb_page_id",
      username = "My example page"
    )
  )
)
```

Now that you have stored these tokens in your local keyring, you can
include at the beginning of your scripts something like this, without
worring that your tokens will be shared involuntarily:

``` r
cc_set(
  fb_user_id = keyring::key_get(service = "fb_user_id"),
  fb_user_token = keyring::key_get(service = "fb_user_token"),
  fb_page_token = keyring::key_get(
    service = "fb_page_token",
    username = "My example page"
  ),
  fb_page_id = keyring::key_get(
    service = "fb_page_id",
    username = "My example page"
  )
)
```

For the sake of simplicity, you may find in this readme and elsewhere in
the documentation example code that may suggest to include your tokens
as plaintext: you now know that with `keyring` there is a better way.
You have been warned.

Here is a script that, if run step by step (read the comments!) should
make it reasonably quick to store securely either short-term or
long-term tokens as well as relevant identifiers for your Facebook pages
and Instagram accounts:

``` r
library("cornucopia")
library("keyring")

# set your keyring name - useful if you want to use separate keyrings for separate accounts
keyring_name <- "your_keyring_name"

# this is to create a new keyring, should be run only once
keyring::keyring_create(keyring = keyring_name)

# generate a short-lived user token with the required permissions from the following page:
# https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/
# likely useful permissions include:
# business_management; instagram_basic; instagram_manage_insights; pages_read_engagement;
# pages_manage_metadata; pages_read_user_content; ads_read; read_insights; pages_show_list;
keyring::key_set(keyring = keyring_name, service = "fb_user_token")

# retrieve and set fb_user_id
keyring::key_set_with_value(
  keyring = keyring_name,
  service = "fb_user_id",
  password = cc_get_fb_user(
    fb_user_token = keyring::key_get(
      keyring = keyring_name,
      service = "fb_user_token"
    )
  ) |>
    dplyr::pull(id)
)

# set for the current session fb_user_token and fb_user_id
cc_set(
  fb_user_token = keyring::key_get(
    keyring = keyring_name,
    service = "fb_user_token"
  ),
  fb_user_id = keyring::key_get(
    keyring = keyring_name,
    service = "fb_user_id"
  )
)

# use the access to retrieve the identifier for the pages you manage
pages_df <- cc_get_fb_managed_pages()


# this will store the page identifier for each page,
# then retrieve the token, and store it as well.
# in order to retrieve it, use the full page name
# consider keeping only the pages you need
pages_df

purrr::walk(
  .progress = TRUE,
  .x = purrr::transpose(.l = pages_df),

      username = current_page[["name"]],
      password = current_page[["id"]]
    )

    current_page_token <- cc_get_fb_page_token(

    keyring = keyring_name,
    service = "fb_user_id"
  )
)

# then add all the other identifiers and tokens as needed:
# they should all be stored in the local keyring
```

#### Once you’ve got your tokens

Now that you have these tokens, you probably want to set them and let
them be used throughout the current session:

``` r
cc_set(
  fb_page_token = fb_page_token,
  fb_page_id = fb_page_id
)
```

(if you prefer, you can actively pass the token to each function call,
or, you may rather prefer to use some other solution to make sure access
tokens are not included in scripts, shared by mistake, etc. )

Good, now you have your Facebook Page Token, which you can use to get
information about your page and posts, what do you do next? (also, be
mindful that the same token can be used also to actually post on your
page, so treat it with due caution and make sure it remains private)

Then, you probably want to get a list of all posts from your page.

``` r
posts_df <- cc_get_fb_page_posts()
```

Yes, you probably have *a lot* of posts, but this function caches result
by default, so you will have to do it only once, and then only newer
posts will be retrieved, so it may be worth your time. If you don’t want
to wait and just need a few posts, then you can retrieve only the most
recent posts with something like:

``` r
posts_df <- cc_get_fb_page_posts(
  max_pages = 10,
  cache = FALSE
)
```

Which will retrieve the most recent 10 pages of posts (each page has 25
posts, so you do the math).

Besides Facebook post id, you already get some other basic information
about each of the posts, namely:

`created_time`, `id`, `permalink_url`, `message`, `full_picture`,
`icon`, `is_hidden`, `is_expired`, `instagram_eligibility`,
`is_eligible_for_promotion`, `promotable_id`, `is_instagram_eligible`,
`is_popular`, `is_published`, `is_spherical`, `parent_id`,
`status_type`, `story`, `subscribed`, `sheduled_publish_time`,
`updated_time`

But you probably want to know more. There’s a bunch of different things
you can find out, and these vary depending on the type of post. But the
most common next step is probably to get some more information about
these posts with:

``` r
cc_get_fb_page_post_insights()
```

\[to do\]

``` r
cc_get_fb_page_insights()
```

``` r
cc_get_fb_page_video()

cc_get_fb_video_insights()
```

### Meta ads

For the time being, `cornucopia` partly relies on
[`fbRads`](https://github.com/daroczig/fbRads) to get data about
sponsored campaigns and store them locally (long terms, all API calls
will be done directly by `cornucopia` for consistency).

``` r
token <- "looooooooooong_string"

account <- "00000000000000000"

fbad_init(
  accountid = account,
  token = token
)

ads_df <- cc_get_fb_ads()
```

Notice that if you ask for a lengthy period, you may hit the API query
limit. The error message is however not helpful, as it apparently
complains about `fields`. Just wait and try again after a few hours: all
downloaded data are by default stored in a local folder and nothing will
be lost, queries will be made only for missing data.

If you’re hitting the API limits but what to proceed with writing your
code as you wait, you can set the `only_cached` parameter to TRUE, so
you can proceed with your analysis with the data you have until you’ll
be able to download more data.

``` r
ads_df <- cc_get_fb_ads(only_cached = TRUE)
```

Notice that you can customise the fields to retrieve and that not all
fields can be asked at the same time. See the embedded list
`cc_valid_fields_ad_insights` for list of valid fields, divided by broad
categories (this subdivision has been made by the package author, not by
Facebook itself). Caching of retrieved contents by type of fields will
be addedt to future versions.

Not all ad-related information, however, can be retrieved through this
endpoint.

### Creatives

For example, if you want details about the creatives used in an ad, you
will first need to make queries to retrieve the `creative_id` associated
with each ad ([see documentation of this
endpoint](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/adgroup/adcreatives/)),
and only then query the [ad creative
endpoint](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/ad-creative/)
to retrieve relevant information about the creative.

The first step of this process, i.e. retrieving `creative_id` can be
achieved by passing a vector of `ad_id` to
[`cc_get_fb_ad_creatives_id()`](https://giocomai.github.io/cornucopia/reference/cc_get_fb_ad_creatives_id.md).
Data will be cached locally by default, assuming creatives will mostly
be added at the time when the ad is created.

### Action breakdowns

Here’s more interesting information, but also where caching gets
trickier. But say, you are interested in `actions` by day and by ad, you
can use `cc_get_fb_ad_actions_by_day`, passing to it a vector of `ad_id`
(or `adset_id`, for that matter, the APIs don’t seem to mind), and
you’ll get a daily breakdown.

You can get even more details: for example, do you want to know how many
of those viewing your video ads had the sound on:

``` r
cc_get_fb_ad_actions_by_day(
  ad_id = example_id,
  type = "actions",
  action_breakdowns = "action_video_sound"
) |>
  dplyr::filter(is.na(action_video_sound) == FALSE)
```

For many such breakdowns, including this one, you get a meaningful
breakdown only if your ad is relevant. For example, if the `example_id`
above is of an ad that does not have any video, no information is
returned. If you ask for `product_id` for an ad that is not based on
catalogue, you won’t get anything. And so on.

See the [official
documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/insights/breakdowns/)
for details.

Caching does not really work with this function at this stage, as no
consistent approach for updating cached data has been implemented, yet.

### Instagram

As for all things related to Meta’s API, you will need an app, and a
valid token with all the needed permissions (not having the right
permissions is the most frequent problem you’ll find, so when
troubleshooting, take it from there).

So first set your `ig_user_id` and your token. If, as may well be the
case, you don’t know your `ig_user_id` you can retrieve it with
[`cc_get_instagram_user_id()`](https://giocomai.github.io/cornucopia/reference/cc_get_instagram_user_id.md),
as long as you have the `fb_page_id` of the Facebook page associated
with the given Instagram account and `fb_user_token` (notice, the user
token, not the page token). For reference, see also [step 5 of this
official
guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/getting-started/).

``` r
cc_set(
  ig_user_id = "00000000000000000", # probably about 17 digits, not the legacy Instagram id
  fb_user_token = "loooong_string"
) # the regular token, not the "page token"
```

And you can get some basic information about your profile:

``` r
cc_get_instagram_user()
```

Or just some specific fields:

``` r
cc_get_instagram_user(fields = c("username", "followers_count"))
```

In order to get detailed information about each of your posts, you first
need to know their `ig_media_id`. You can get this id for all of your
posts with the following command:

``` r
cc_get_instagram_media_id()
```

Be mindful that this may make many queries, as Instagram gives the
result in batches of 25… if you have thousands of media, it may take
some time. Data are however cached locally by default.

You can then pass the resulting `ig_media_id` to
[`cc_get_instagram_media()`](https://giocomai.github.io/cornucopia/reference/cc_get_instagram_media.md)
to get more information about a given Instagram post.

``` r
cc_get_instagram_media()
```

Responses to
[`cc_get_instagram_media()`](https://giocomai.github.io/cornucopia/reference/cc_get_instagram_media.md)
are cached by default, and updated with decreasing frequency as posts
get older (data are refreshed every day for the last week, once a week
for the last month, once a month for the last year, once a year for
previous years). As a consequence, you should mostly be able to keep
this in scripts and rely on it to autoaupdate data without much delay.

### Retrieve information about other Instagram users

Instagram Graph APIs allow to retrieve information about other users
through a mechanism known as [“business
discovery”](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/instagram-graph-api/reference/ig-user/business_discovery/).

This allows to retrieve basic information about a user (e.g follower
count bio, etc.), as well as about their posts (e.g. likes count). Using
this function it’s much easier to hit usage limits… usage limits,
however, reset after one hour, so through caching and waiting you can
still go a long way.

For example, to retrieve some information about the Instagram account of
the United Nation, you would run:

``` r
cc_get_instagram_bd_user(ig_username = "unitednations")
```

To retrieve information about individual posts, you would proceed as
follows:

``` r
cc_get_instagram_bd_user_media(ig_username = "unitednations", max_pages = 1)
```

Considering restrictive rate limits imposed by the API, you are likely
to hit them quite soon: if stuck, wait for a hour, and they should
reset.

By default, caching is enabled, so all retrieved data are stored.

The function
[`cc_get_instagram_bd_user_media()`](https://giocomai.github.io/cornucopia/reference/cc_get_instagram_bd_user_media.md)
has three main modes:

- default is `mode = "update"`: it starts retrieving posts from the most
  recent; even if they have previously been retrieved, it checks them
  again in order to provide the latest available data
- in order to retrieve all posts, starting with the earliest available,
  you would set `mode = "full"`: if
  [`cc_get_instagram_bd_user_media()`](https://giocomai.github.io/cornucopia/reference/cc_get_instagram_bd_user_media.md)
  has been run previously, it starts from the oldest retrieved post and
  goes backward. N.B. more recent posts are not retrieved!
- cached data can be retrieved with `mode = "only_cached"`; no new
  queries are made when this mode is set.

Considering setting `max_pages` to limit how many posts are retrieved
(each page returned from the API includes information about 25 posts).

### Retrieve leads from Meta ads

In order to retrieve leads from ad campaigns that rely on Meta’s native
forms, you should make sure that your user token has the right
permissions (it must include `leads_retrieval`).

Then you must get the identifier of your lead form: you can see it when
you create it, when you download leads as a csv from a single ad, or
from the dedicated section in the ads manager. You should be aware that
only the form id matters; all leads from that form will be retrieved, no
matter the the ad set or ad in which it is included (reference to adset
and ad are however included in the returned data frame along with the
form responses).

``` r
cc_get_fb_leads(form_id = "insert_form_id_here")
```

You can of course feed these data into your own workflows,
e.g. uploading them to Google Sheets with
[`googlesheets4`](https://github.com/tidyverse/googlesheets4/), and even
do this recurrently, by running e.g. the script every hour as faciliated
by packages such as [`cronR`](https://github.com/bnosac/cronR) or
[`taskscheduleR`](https://github.com/bnosac/taskscheduleR).

### Visualising campaign structure

If the campaign structure is not exceedingly complex, it may be possible
to visualise its structure giving it the shape of a flowchart. The
following function, previously included in the package and later dropped
in order to reduce dependencies, allows to achieve this simply by
passing to it an `ads_df` data frame as retrieved with
[`cc_get_fb_ads()`](https://giocomai.github.io/cornucopia/reference/cc_get_fb_ads.md).

In order to work, it requires the separate package `nomnomlgraph` which
can be installed with
`remotes::install_github("giocomai/nomnomlgraph")`.

``` r

#' Show ad campaign structure in a nomnmonl graph
#'
#' @param direction Defaults to "right". Can be "down". Passed to `nomnoml`.
#' @param drop_vertical_bar Defaults to FALSE. If TRUE, replaces vertical bar
#'   (which in `nomnoml` can be used to separate a block in subsections) with
#'   "-".
cc_nomnoml <- function(ads_df,
                       direction = "right",
                       drop_vertical_bar = FALSE,
                       ...) {
  nodes_df <- dplyr::bind_rows(
    dplyr::distinct(
      .data = ads_df,
      id = campaign_id,
      text = campaign_name
    ),
    dplyr::distinct(
      .data = ads_df,
      id = adset_id,
      text = adset_name
    ),
    dplyr::distinct(
      .data = ads_df,
      id = ad_id,
      text = ad_name
    )
  )


  if (drop_vertical_bar == TRUE) {
    nodes_df <- nodes_df |>
      dplyr::mutate(text = stringr::str_replace_all(
        string = text,
        pattern = stringr::fixed("|"),
        replacement = "-"
      ))
  }



  edges_df <- dplyr::bind_rows(
    dplyr::distinct(
      .data = ads_df,
      from = campaign_id,
      to = adset_id
    ),
    dplyr::distinct(
      .data = ads_df,
      from = adset_id,
      to = ad_id
    )
  ) |>
    dplyr::mutate(association = "-")

  nomnomlgraph::nn_graph(
    nodes = nodes_df,
    edges = edges_df,
    direction = direction,
    ...
  )
}
```

## LinkedIn

LinkedIn does not allow for exporting statistics about pages or ads
systematically, if not by using one of a very small number of
ridiculously expensive third party services.

This complicated the independent processing of the data, as well as
their inclusion in third party dashboard.

To deal with both of these issues, `cornucopia` includes a set of
functions that facilitates:

- processing files with statistics exported from LinkedIn
- store them locally in a consistent manner
- keep them updated in a set of Google Sheets, in order to facilitate
  their integration with services such as Looker Studio

The user just needs to download relevant files and store them in a
folder, without paying attention to anything else, really. Files for
more than one page can be included in the same folder and no special
attention needs to be dedicated to the time period included:
`cornucopia` will always strive to include data for the longest possible
period, always preferring the most recent data available. For this
reason, it is usually easiest to export data about the last 365 days,
and let this package deal with the rest.

Export files for all sorts of a statics from your LinkedIn page. They
will have file names such as “pagename_followers_1684688073420.xls”.
Throw all of them in a folder, that we’ll call “LinkedIn_stats”.

You can then retrieve some basic information about these files using:

``` r
cc_get_linkedin_stats_files(path = "LinkedIn_stats")
```

This allows to see when a file was exported, what is the name of the
page, and what type of statistics it includes: all of this information
can be gathered from the file name.

Each of the statistics types exported from LinkedIn has its own data
format, and indeed there is little consistency in these files, if not
for the ridiculous insistence on including dates in the ridiculous US
date format (month-day-year), no matter where you are in the world.

Anyway… we can now move on to the specific functions for each type of
statistics. The following functions parse all relevant files and merge
the data preferring the most recently downloaded data over older files
(this may be irrelevant in many cases, but may well have some impact in
statistics associated with a given post).

``` r
followers_df <- cc_get_linkedin_stats_followers(
  path = "LinkedIn_stats",
  page = "example-page"
)
```

Once we have these data, we can of course process them as we usually
would. But for the sake of this post, we are imagining a workflow that
requires us to upload these files to a Google Sheet, in order to
facilitate data retrieval through Google Looker Studio.

We can do this manually, but, of course, we’d much rather use a set of
convenience functions that will process data and upload them
automatically to the same Google Sheet, updating the dataset if one was
previously uploaded.

``` r
cc_drive_upload_linkedin_stats_followers(
  path = "LinkedIn_stats",
  page_name = "example-page"
)

cc_drive_upload_linkedin_stats_content(
  path = "LinkedIn_stats",
  page_name = "example-page"
)

cc_drive_upload_linkedin_stats_visitors(
  path = "LinkedIn_stats",
  page_name = "example-page"
)
```

## Google Analytics

Only the most tentative integration with Google Analytics has so far
been implemented, relying on
[googleAnalyticsR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/googleAnalyticsR/index.html).

If you are interested in the ratio (possibly, calculated as a rolling
average), consider something such as the following.

``` r
cc_set(
  ga_email = "example@example.com",
  ga_property_id = 123456789
)

cc_get_ga_event_ratio(events = c("session_start", "purchase"))

cc_get_ga_event_ratio(
  events = c("session_start", "purchase"),
  rolling = TRUE
)
```

This is a quick implementation, and further convenience functions based
on
[googleAnalyticsR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/googleAnalyticsR/index.html)
may be introduced, including local caching.
